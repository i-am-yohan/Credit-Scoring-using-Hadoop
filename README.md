# Credit-Scoring-using-Hadoop
This is some work that was done for a class project. A simple credit scorecard model built using hadoop map-reduce.

This was done as a excersize to see if map-reduce could be used to build and train credit scorecard models. 
A typical credit scorcard model is a logistic regression trained on data where the independent variables are binned by their weigths of evidence.
The dependent variable is usually a binary indicator indicating the presence of a credit default.
The accompanying report details the entire process.
